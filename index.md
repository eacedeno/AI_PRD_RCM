# AI Product Requirements Document (PRD) 

## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** AI Denial Reason Predictor (AI-DRP)
**Date:**  06/02/2025
**Author:**  Edward Cedeno
**Stakeholders:** Healthcare Technology Providers  
**Version:**  v25.06.02

**Summary:**  
Denials in the healthcare revenue cycle represent a significant source of revenue leakage and increased administrative burden. Many claim denials are predictable through existing data such as patient eligibility, coding accuracy, and documentation quality; however, current workflows fail to proactively surface these risks before claim submission.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered denial prediction system that predicts both the likelihood of claim denial and the specific reason for denial prior to submission. Leveraging historical claims data and advanced machine learning models hosted on AWS SageMaker, the system will provide real-time, actionable insights to billing teams and revenue cycle managers.

By integrating with existing workflows via APIs and dashboards, the solution will enable proactive interventions—such as correcting claim errors or submitting prior authorizations—to reduce denial rates, improve revenue recovery, and lower administrative costs. The system will be designed for scalability, security, and compliance with healthcare regulations, with ongoing model retraining and explainability features to build user trust and operational resilience.

Key benefits include measurable reductions in denial rates, faster claim processing times, increased appeal success rates, and improved cost efficiency in the revenue cycle management process.

## 2. Problem Statement
Denials are a major source of revenue leakage and administrative cost in the revenue cycle. Many are predictable with existing data such as patient eligibility, documentation quality, and coding—but current RCM workflows fail to surface this insight before claim submission.


## 3. Goals & Objectives
Predict the likelihood and reason for claim denial before submission, allowing proactive interventions to reduce denials. The purpose is to reduce denial rates and improve revenue recovery by providing real-time, AI-generated predictions of claim denial likelihood and specific denial reasons before submission.
- Reduce overall claim denial rate by 25% within 6 months of implementing the AI Denial Reason Prediction tool.
- Achieve a 95% first-pass acceptance rate for submitted claims within the first year.
- Ensure that the AI model predicts specific denial reasons with at least 85% accuracy compared to payer responses.
- Generate denial risk predictions for at least 90% of claims before they are submitted.
- Decrease time spent on resubmitting or appealing denied claims by 40% through early detection and correction.
- All high-risk claims (risk score above threshold) receive actionable feedback within 5 minutes of detection.
- Increase revenue recovered from initially denied claims by 15% through targeted interventions prompted by AI insights.
- Reduce average claim lifecycle (submission to adjudication) by 2 days due to fewer denials and rework cycles.
- At least 80% of coders/billers actively review and act on AI denial predictions within 3 months of rollout.

| **Output**                | Denial probability + reason + confidence + fix suggestion | Real-world users (billing managers, AI scrubbers) need not just a score but actionable insight — including the *why* and *how to fix*.                                                                                                       |
| **Training**              | SageMaker Pipelines + regular retraining                  | Keeps model updated with new payer behavior, coding changes, or policy shifts.                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Explainability**        | SageMaker Clarify (SHAP values)                           | Provides interpretable outputs that help product managers and compliance teams justify predictions and build trust.                                                                                                                          |



**5.2. Key Features**

- CPT / ICD-10 Encodings: Raw codes are categorical — embeddings capture relationships (e.g., 99213 is close to 99214). Helps the model generalize better to new but similar codes.
- Payer Denial History: Historical payer behavior patterns are strong predictors. If Payer A denies 97140 20% of the time, the model needs that prior.
- Prior Authorization Required: Payers often deny for lack of prior auth — this binary flag signals risk. May be inferred from payer rules or EHR fields.
- Claim Timeliness: Delayed submissions often result in timely filing denials (CARC 29). This numeric feature identifies those risk cases.
- Diagnosis-Procedure Match: NLP similarity score between ICD-10 and procedure note can catch medical necessity denials.
- Eligibility Verified: Binary flag — if eligibility wasn’t verified via Availity or a Payer API, eligibility-related denials become more likely.
- Global Period Flag: Captures whether a procedure should be bundled under a prior surgery, affecting bundling-related denials.
